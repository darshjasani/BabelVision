## Project Key Points

Focus on language learning: While Google Lens is a general-purpose visual search tool, this project would be specifically tailored for language learning.
Augmented Reality: This project emphasizes using AR to overlay information directly on the camera view, whereas Google Lens typically provides information on a separate screen.
Interactive learning features: The proposed project includes elements like pronunciation guides and quizzes, which are not part of Google Lens.
Customization for language pairs: Users would be able to select specific language combinations, unlike Google Lens which primarily translates to the user's device language.
Offline capabilities: Potentially, this app could be designed to work offline for core features, which Google Lens generally doesn't support.
